## General Information
You need to make the longest possible sequence of moves (tour) with a chess knight, visiting each cell only once.

If you have visited each cell, then you have achieved a full tour. If you have made a complete tour and were able to move from your last position to the starting cell, then you have reached the closed full tour.
